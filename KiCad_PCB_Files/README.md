These are the pcb files for the Spot welder V3

There is a new V3.1 of the mosfet board available. It is fully compatible with the Arduino Board V3, so you only need to upgrade the mosfet board if you already built a V3 Spot Welder. 

Improvements:

    4 TVS diodes instead of only 1

This improvement makes it more capable of higher CCA rated car batteries. In my tests it handled a 800 CCA car battery for a few hundred welds in a row without problems. But using this powerfull batteries operates the welder near its maximum limits so the recommended car battery size is still 400...600 CCA

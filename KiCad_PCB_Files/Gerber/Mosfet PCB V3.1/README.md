These are the Gerber files for the Mosfet PCB V3.1. Please order it with 2oz copper layer at the pcb manufacturer because it needs to take a lot of current.

Improvements:
- 4 TVS diodes instead of only 1

This improvement makes it more capable of higher CCA rated car batteries. In my tests it handled a 800 CCA car battery for a few hundred welds without problems.
But using this powerfull batteries operates the welder near its maximum limits so the recommended car battery size is still 400...600 CCA

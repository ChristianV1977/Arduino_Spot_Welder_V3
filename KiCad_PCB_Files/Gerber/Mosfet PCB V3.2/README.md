These are the Gerber files for the Mosfet PCB V3.2. Please order it with 2oz copper layer at the pcb manufacturer because it needs to take a lot of current.

Improvements/Changes:

    The 8 small TVS diodes have been removed from the mosfet board in V3.2 . 
    There is now one TVS diode on the Arduino Board instead,that does the protection job.

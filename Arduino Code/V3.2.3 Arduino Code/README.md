Changes in V3.2.3

Bugfix: 
The weld counter does now automatically reset to 0 as soon as it reaches 9999 welds.
This was done because the display failed when the weld counter reached 10.000 welds, due to problems with variable types.

In case you dont want to update your software to the latest version:
In the older software versions you can solve the display problem by doing a "Full Reset" in the system menu. 
This will reset the weld counter to 0. Then you can do 9999 welds before the problem occurs again.
